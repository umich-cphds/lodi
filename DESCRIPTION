Title: Censored Likelihood Multiple Imputation for Single-Pollutant Models
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Jonathan Boss
Maintainer: Jonathan Boss <bossjona@umich.edu>
Description: This package implements Censored likelihood Multiple Imputation
    (CLMI), a method for imputing values below the limit of detection in
    single-pollutant models. Our implementation of CLMI handles exposure
    detection limits that may change throughout the course of exposure
    assessment. 'lodmi' provides functions for imputing and pooling.
