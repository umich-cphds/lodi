Description: Impute observed values below the limit of detection (LOD) via
    Censored likelihood Multiple Imputation (CLMI) in single-pollutant
    models. CLMI handles exposure detection limits that may change throughout
    the course of exposure assessment. 'lodi' provides functions for imputing
    and pooling via this method.
