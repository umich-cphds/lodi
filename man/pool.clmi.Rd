\title{Calculate pooled estimates from \code{clmi.out} objects}
\usage{
pool.clmi(clmi.out, regression.type = c("logistic, linear"),
  outcome.covars = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{clmi.out}{an object generated by clmi.}

\item{regression.type}{type of regression to pool. Valid types are
"logistic" and "linear".}

\item{outcome.covars}{a character vector of variables associated
with the outcome. Only include variable names for variables that were
not used during imputation (variables that were used for imputation
are automatically adjusted for).}
